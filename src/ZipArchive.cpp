 * This method kept throwing an exception when zipArchive was passed as `ZipArchive zipArchive`.
 * After a good amount of tedious debugging, I realized that zipArchive was being created at each
 * call to zip_stat_index and zip_fopen_index, and then destroyed on return. Changing to passing
 * zipArchive as a pointer rather than a reference facilitated persistence of zipArchive throughout
 * the calls and returns, eliminating throw of an exception.
