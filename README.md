## Description

   Xsltpeds is an application and XSLT formatting to facilitate viewing
   search results downloaded in XML format from the USPTO's [Patent
   Examination Data System](https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/).
   
   Xsltpeds is the successor to the Bash-script-based [XSLT_PEDS](https://github.com/dfyockey/XSLT_PEDS). While
   this application is beneficial to Linux users, the motivation for
   this project was particularly to simplify setup and usage within
   Microsoft Windows.
