## Description

   _The subject of this project is under development but not yet
   functional. The following include forward-looking statements._

   Xsltpeds is an application and XSLT formatting to facilitate viewing
   search results downloaded in XML format from the USPTO's Patent
   Examination Data System (https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/).
   
   Xsltpeds is the successor to the Bash-script-based XSLT_PEDS. While
   this application is beneficial to Linux users, the motivation for
   this project was particularly to simplify setup and usage within
   Microsoft Windows.
